Beginner's Arduino Uno projects.

It all started when I randomly thought about buying an Arduino Uno - now I'm having fun experimenting with electronics.

Necessary schematics provided in respective folders.

## List of projects:
1. ThreeLEDs - Three LEDs flashing. They turn on one by one, then turn off one by one.
2. ButtonLED - Pressing the button turns the LED on.
3. CapacitorValue - Measures the capacitance of a capacitor; currently not working.
4. ArduinoTwitchBot - for more info, visit https://github.com/Stukeley/ArduinoTwitchBot

## Upcoming project ideas:
1. Twitch Chat alert listener - flash LEDs when something happens in a Twitch chat (eg. somebody sends a message, follows the channel, etc).
